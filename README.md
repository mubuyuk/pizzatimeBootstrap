Project Description

In this project, I have built a dynamic and responsive pizza shop website, PizzaTime, where users can explore menus, add products to a shopping cart, and place orders. The project focuses on providing a smooth user experience using modern web development techniques and interactive features.

The main purpose of the project has been to explore and practice building a website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
